Cricket Analytics ("Criclytics") is capstone project from last semester in CDAC ACTS Pune, 2018

###	PROBLEM STATEMENT

Based upon above acquired data, we have proposed to perform “Criclytics” i.e. Cricket Analysis which has predictions based upon following 2 categories.

  *	For Team:
	Winning and Score predictor (WASP) using predictive analysis to predict the result of the match based upon various factors like team record against opposition,
	venue where match is being played etc.

  * For Individual Players:
    Predicting final Innings score of respective team based upon average statistics of respective players impact in average conditions. 

### SCOPE OF PROBLEM STATEMENT

Above problem statement is applicable for all the matches that are played on International level under ICC authorization wing including Test, One-day International and T-20 Matches. 

### WHAT IS THE MARKET NEED OF PROJECT

Project can be produce effective value for money in Betting Institutions and Fantasy leagues like Dream11, IPL fantasy leagues etc. It can even assist IPL franchises for comparative analysis to determine which Player should they invest upon and who will be better will be better value for money.   

### WHY IT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED TRIVIALLY

Current ICC protocol implements Cricket score predictions based only upon Current Average Scoring rate of match. The trivial Score predictions doesn’t consider fall of Wickets and past history of player against particular opponent and on particular ground, Which makes Score predictions less accurate and less interesting.
